<p>I goofed in recitation yesterday when we were talking about preorder, inorder, and postorder DFS.</p>
<p>Immediately prior, when were talking about breadth first search on binary trees, I had the following pseudocode on the board:</p>
<pre><code>BFS(root):
  q = new Queue
  q.enqueue(root)

  while q is not empty:
    current = q.dequeue()
    print current  // or process current somehow
    if current.left exists, then q.enqueue(current.left)
    if current.right exists, then q.enqueue(current.right)
</code></pre><p>Then I waved my arms and said that to convert this BFS code to DFS, you just had to replace &quot;queue&quot; with &quot;stack&quot; (and change all the relevant operations, e.g. &quot;enqueue&quot; ⇒ &quot;push&quot;, &quot;dequeue&quot; ⇒ &quot;pop&quot;). So we&#39;d have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ConvertedDFS(root):
  s = new Stack
  s.push(root)

  while s is not empty:
    current = s.pop()
    print current  // or process current somehow
    if current.left exists, then s.push(current.left)
    if current.right exists, then s.push(current.right)
</code></pre><p>Well, is this DFS? Yes, technically, but it requires some clarification in the context of what we talked about next: preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal.</p>
<p>Namely, recall that we can change the traversal order by moving this line around:</p>
<pre><code>print current  // or process current somehow
</code></pre><p>So to get <strong>inorder</strong> traversal, we&#39;d write:</p>
<pre><code>process left
process current
process right
</code></pre><p>and <strong>postorder</strong> would be:</p>
<pre><code>process left
process right
process current
</code></pre><p>Given all this, you would <em>think</em> that after replacing &quot;queue&quot; with &quot;stack&quot; in the BFS code above, we&#39;d end up with <strong>preorder DFS</strong>, since we&#39;re processing the <code>current</code> node <em>prior to</em> processing its children. Then, we could move around the &quot;process <code>current</code>&quot; line to change the ordering of the traversal, right?</p>
<p><em>In reality</em> (and this is where I goofed), directly converting the above pseudocode to DFS will always give you &quot;backwards preorder&quot; traversal -- <em>regardless of where you move the &quot;process current node&quot; line</em>.</p>
<p>What do I mean by &quot;backwards preorder&quot;? Good question, because it&#39;s not really a thing. Suppose I have the following tree:</p>
<pre><code>      5
     / \
    2   7
   / \   \
  1   4   11
</code></pre><p>For this tree, we&#39;d expect that following orderings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preorder:</strong> <code>5, 2, 1, 4, 7, 11</code></li>
<li><strong>Inorder:</strong> <code>1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11</code></li>
<li><strong>Postorder:</strong> <code>1, 4, 2, 11, 7, 5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that converting the BFS pseudocode to DFS will print the above tree in the following &quot;backwards preorder&quot;: <code>5, 7, 11, 2, 4, 1</code>. </p>
<p>This is exactly what would happen if you first mirrored the tree, and then did preorder traversal. Alternatively, using the dot-and-trace trick from recitation, this is what would happen if we did <em>post</em>order traversal starting from the root and tracing down the <em>right</em> perimeter of the tree first (instead of the left, which is how it normally works).</p>
<p>Why does this happen? The reason is pretty simple, actually. When we push a child onto the stack, we <em>aren&#39;t actually processing the child</em>. That is,</p>
<pre><code>s.push(current.left)
</code></pre><p>is different from </p>
<pre><code>process left
</code></pre><p>which would look more like</p>
<pre><code>print current.left
s.push(current.left.left)
s.push(current.left.right)
</code></pre><p>In other words, in our converted DFS pseudocode, we aren&#39;t actually processing the left and right children quite yet. We&#39;re just <em>adding them to the stack</em>, which is sort of like the &quot;waiting area&quot; for processing. In fact, we don&#39;t actually start processing a new node until the current loop iteration wraps up, and we restart and <code>s.pop()</code> spits out a new <code>current</code> for us to work with.</p>
<p>Now, because a stack is <strong>LIFO (last in, first out)</strong>, <code>s.pop()</code> spits out children in reverse order, <em>regardless of whether we pushed their parent before, after, or between them</em>.</p>
<p>So even if the body of my loop looks like:</p>
<pre><code>while blah blah:
  push left
  process current
  ...500 lines of useless gibberish...
  push right
  ...500 more lines of gibberish...
</code></pre><p>we still only process one node (<code>current</code>) in this iteration, and at the end of that iteration, calling <code>s.pop()</code> will return items starting from the most recently inserted.</p>
<p>This means we always end up with the following processing order:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>current</code> (the only item processed on this iteration)</li>
<li><code>right</code> (the result of calling <code>s.pop()</code> on the next iteration)</li>
<li><code>left</code> (the result of calling <code>s.pop()</code> on the next-next iteration)</li>
</ol>
<p>How do we remedy this problem? Rather than just converting the BFS pseudocode to DFS by replacing &quot;queue&quot; with &quot;stack&quot;, we can use the following:</p>
<pre><code>DFS(root):
    print root  // or check its value, or whatever
    if root has left child, then DFS(left)
    if root has right chid, then DFS(right)
    return
</code></pre><p>This recursive pseudocode essentially implements the exact same algorithm, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">execution stack</a> (also referred to as the &quot;call stack&quot;) as our &quot;stack.&quot; In other words, this time we <em>actually</em> <code>DFS()</code> the children on the spot, instead of just <code>s.push()</code>ing them into stack purgatory to wait another iteration or two to get processed.</p>
<p>Hopefully that clears things up for folks, and big ups to the two people who backchannelled me for clarification! Sometimes I say things that make literally no sense, so you should def bring these things to my attention  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></article></main><footer><p>Written by Sarah Lim (slim at northwestern dot edu)</p></footer></div><script src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14218448/assets/prism.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/x-mathjax-config">MathJax.Hub.Config({
