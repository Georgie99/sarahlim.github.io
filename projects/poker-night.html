<p>I designed the poster for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4958758/">Poker Night</a>, a short film written and directed by Jack Forbes. Jack wanted a photorealistic depiction of the physical coin used in the movie. Using a photograph of the coin for reference, I reconstructed it in Illustrator and then used Photoshop blending options to mimic the texture and lighting of the physical version.</p>
