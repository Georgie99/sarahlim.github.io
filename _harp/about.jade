            #[strong I am a second-year computer science student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.] I made my first website at the age of seven using the Netscape WYSIWYG composer and many invisible tables.

            To me, the most fascinating problems are  interdisciplinary ones. I firmly believe that the social sciences, humanities, and arts can indispensably enrich traditional CS approaches. As a researcher and designer, my goal is to build systems to overcome social barriers, incorporating knowledge from any and all relevant domains.

            At Northwestern, I'm lucky to be part of the #[a(href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu") Design, Technology, and Research] group under the #[a(href="http://delta.northwestern.edu") Delta Lab]. My current work aims to help learners reverse-engineer web layouts generated by AngularJS and React. Broadly, I am interested in human-computer interaction (HCI), learning sciences, accessibility, and social computing.

            I recently switched to #[a(href="http://harpjs.com") Harp.js] for my static site generator, and I love it. I use #[a(href="http://jade-lang.com/") Jade] for templating and #[a(href="http://sass-lang.com/") Sass] for CSS.

            Any portraits were taken by the very talented #[a(href="https://www.facebook.com/matthewzhangphotography") Matthew Zhang], and other photography is from #[a(href="http://unsplash.com") Unsplash].

            I also made #[a(href="http://eecs.northwestern.edu/~scl025") this website], which is arguably better.
