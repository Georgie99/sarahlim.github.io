I am a fourth-year undergraduate in [Computer Science](http://eecs.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern University, supervised by [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq), [Nell O'Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com), and [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/). I am a member of [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu) and the [Delta Lab](http://delta.northwestern.edu).

My research interests broadly intersect HCI, computing education, programming languages, and software engineering. I particularly enjoy working on **developer tools** and **programming environments** to scaffold and support **non-expert programmers**.

I've been generously supported by the Google Lime Scholarship, Palantir Women in Technology Scholarship, Microsoft Tuition Scholarship, and Box Engineering Diversity Scholarship. Thanks, companies!

This summer, I will intern with [Human Experience and Design](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/) at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/), UK. I will join [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org) as a software engineer in Fall 2018, helping to build a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.

### Service and Teaching

- I'm a **head teaching assistant** for introductory EECS courses, with a particular focus on mentoring students without prior programming experience. Most of [my efforts](#teaching) have revolved around curriculum development for *EECS 111: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I* at Northwestern.
- I started an **onboarding and mentorship** program for [DTR](http://dtr.northwestern.edu), working to pair new researchers with experienced student mentors.
- I sit on the [Weinberg Student Advisory Board](http://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/enrichment-opportunities/sab/), **representing Computer Science majors** in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.
- During the 2016-17 school year, I was one of two students serving alongside faculty on the [Weinberg Curricular Review Committee](https://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty/teaching-research-service/teaching-curriculum/curricular-committee-actions/#CRC), **reviewing proposed changes to majors, minors, and academic offerings** within the College.

### Past Experience

I've completed **software engineering** internships at:

- [Khan Academy](http://engineering.khanacademy.org/), where I rebuilt exercise reports, and helped build the LearnStorm 2017 dashboard [these kids](https://twitter.com/khanacademy/status/916413918347776000) are cheering at.
- [LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/), where I wrote an SVG charting library to replace [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) in production on the InMail Reporting Hub, and worked on relevance algorithms.

I was previously a **research assistant** in the following groups:

- [Center for Connected Learning](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern, directed by [Prof. Uri Wilensky](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/Uri.shtml). I developed extensions and implemented experimental Web Worker threading for [NetLogo Web](http://netlogoweb.org).
- [Early Childhood Cognition Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/eccl/) at the University of Washington, assisting [Prof. Jessica Sommerville](http://depts.washington.edu/eccl/people/)'s research into prosocial behavioral awareness during infancy.

Neither here nor there:

- I was a **digital campaigns** intern at [Common Cause Illinois](http://www.commoncause.org/states/illinois/about/?referrer=https://www.google.com/), where I worked on branding and graphic design for the Fair Elections Illinois and Chicago For Net Neutrality campaigns.

### Miscellanea

- My mood is well-correlated with my current streak on the New York Times **crossword puzzle**.
- I avidly enjoy **classical music** and **jazz**. I have been playing the flute since I was nine.
- I'm a former **policy debater**. I founded the nationally-ranked [Interlake Policy Debate Team](http://www.interlakedebate.org/) and was part of the [Northwestern Debate Society](https://www.communication.northwestern.edu/learn/student_activities/debate)'s 15th national championship squad. I also coached for high school programs across the country, taught a lab at the [Northwestern Debate Institute](https://nhsi.northwestern.edu/debate-division/) on the surveillance topic, and worked at the [Stanford National Forensic Institute](https://snfi.stanford.edu/) on the oceans topic.
