I am a rising senior undergraduate in [Computer Science](http://eecs.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O'Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com) through [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu) and the [Delta Lab](http://delta.northwestern.edu). 

I work on **developer tools** and **programming environments** to scaffold and support **non-expert programmers**. My research interests are broadly in the areas of human-computer interaction (HCI), computing education, programming languages, and software engineering (PLSE). My technical interests include functional programming and all aspects of engineering the web, from CSS semantics to browser engine internals.

I am generously supported by the Google Lime Scholarship, Palantir Women in Technology Scholarship, Microsoft Tuition Scholarship, and Box Engineering Diversity Scholarship.

### Service

- I'm a **head teaching assistant** for introductory EECS courses, with a particular focus on mentoring students without prior programming experience. Most of [my efforts](#teaching) have revolved around curriculum development for *EECS 111: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I* at Northwestern.
- I sit on the [Weinberg Student Advisory Board](http://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/enrichment-opportunities/sab/), **representing Computer Science majors** in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.
- During the 2016-17 school year, I was one of two students serving alongside faculty on the [Weinberg Curricular Review Committee](https://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty/teaching-research-service/teaching-curriculum/curricular-committee-actions/#CRC), **reviewing proposed changes to majors, minors, and academic offerings** within the College.

### Experience

As of Summer 2017, I am a software engineering intern at [Khan Academy](http://engineering.khanacademy.org/). Previous internships and summer jobs have included:

- **Frontend engineering** (and a dash of machine learning) at [LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/), building recruiter products
- **Research software engineering** at the [Center for Connected Learning](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/) under [Prof. Uri Wilensky](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/Uri.shtml), developing extensions for [NetLogo Web](http://netlogoweb.org)
- **Graphic design** at [Common Cause Illinois](http://www.commoncause.org/states/illinois/about/?referrer=https://www.google.com/), working on the Fair Elections Illinois and Chicago For Net Neutrality campaigns
- **Research assistance** at the University of Washington [Early Childhood Cognition Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/eccl/) under [Prof. Jessica Sommerville](http://depts.washington.edu/eccl/people/), studying prosocial behavioral awareness during infancy

### Miscellanea

- I really like **classical music**, and have been playing the flute since I was nine.
- For six years, I thought almost exclusively about **policy debate**.
    - I founded the nationally-ranked [Interlake Policy Debate Team](http://www.interlakedebate.org/) and was part of the [Northwestern Debate Society](https://www.communication.northwestern.edu/learn/student_activities/debate)'s 15th national championship squad.
    - I coached for high school programs across the country, taught a lab at the [Northwestern Debate Institute](https://nhsi.northwestern.edu/debate-division/) on the surveillance topic, and worked at the [Stanford National Forensic Institute](https://snfi.stanford.edu/) on the oceans topic.
