I am a rising senior undergraduate in [Computer Science](http://eecs.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O'Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com) through [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu) and the [Delta Lab](http://delta.northwestern.edu). 

I work on **developer tools** and **programming environments** to scaffold and support **non-expert programmers**. My research interests are broadly in the areas of human-computer interaction (HCI), computing education, programming languages, and software engineering (PLSE). My technical interests include functional programming and all aspects of engineering the web, from CSS semantics to browser engine internals.

I am generously supported by the Google Lime Scholarship, Palantir Women in Technology Scholarship, Microsoft Tuition Scholarship, and Box Engineering Diversity Scholarship.

*Service:* At Northwestern, I serve as a head teaching assistant for introductory computer science courses, with a particular focus on mentoring students without prior programming experience. I also serve on the [Weinberg Student Advisory Board](http://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/enrichment-opportunities/sab/), representing the fast-growing contingent of Computer Science students enrolled in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

*Experience:* This summer, I am working at [Khan Academy](http://engineering.khanacademy.org/) as a software engineering intern. Previous gigs include [LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/) (UI engineering on the Recruiter team); the [Center for Connected Learning](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/) under [Prof. Uri Wilensky](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/Uri.shtml) (developing extensions for [NetLogo Web](http://netlogoweb.org)); and the University of Washington [Early Childhood Cognition Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/eccl/) under [Prof. Jessica Sommerville](http://depts.washington.edu/eccl/people/) (studying prosocial behavioral awareness during infancy).

*Other:* I am a Big Fan of classical music, and have been playing the flute since I was nine. In a past life, I founded the nationally-ranked [Interlake Policy Debate Team](http://www.interlakedebate.org/) and was part of the [Northwestern Debate Society](https://www.communication.northwestern.edu/learn/student_activities/debate)'s 15th national championship squad. I also coached for high school programs across the country.
