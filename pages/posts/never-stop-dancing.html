It didn't set in after Berkeley that I was done with high school debate. At the time, I chalked up my lackluster reaction to blunted affect cont.; as I stuffed G2s and flash drives into my backpack and saved "GIRAFFE JUDGE COMMENTS.docx" for the last time, little concerned me besides the balmy sunshine and budget-friendly dining options awaiting me outside. But then it was the weekend of the TOC and I was sharing an uncomfortably-antebellum roof with so many people who had shaped my career, and suddenly every hallway exchange with an old labmate could be our last. The entire thing had an oddly spectral quality; I was just another senior, but eerily detached as a non-competitor – as if my peers were locked in their competitive enclaves and I floated outside it all, observing the details of their interactions and pondering the way this community operates on the other side of the glass.

There was a surreal finitude to the whole weekend. It was the first time many saw me as more than a kid, and the last time I'd see others who had been very good to me. Even if our paths were guaranteed a future intersection, with the ending of a chapter it seemed only appropriate to turn the page on a good note, and so while you closed doors in the 2nr I closed doors on those lingering ends and uncertainties left ajar from three years of being raised by the village. If you were part of that, thank you. Closure is a gift I've come to treasure, not an always-afforded courtesy.

On the way back to Chicago, Misael said something that really resonated with me: that during his career, he wanted to be "good," not "good for a UDL school." When I was younger, I wore the small school sticker like a badge. I felt that not going to Greenhill or having someone to cut cards for me somehow made me the victim of vast injustices. I used to get so sad watching labmates ascend the Google Docs while I passed another weekend at home. Kids are melodramatic, and I was no exception; we bought into the us-against-them clash of the scrappy indepeasants v. the faceless, nameless superteams from St. Glenhillminster of the Sacred Crest who had SO MANY COACHES, MOM. I derived a large portion of my identity from being from Interlake; I felt entitled to resentment. It took me too long to realize just how reprehensible that attitude was.

There's a fine line between holding onto your roots and letting them define you. Halfway through my second year I understood what Misael was telling me a few days ago; not living in the North Shore wasn't an excuse to whine or denigrate or underperform. I had a great dice roll, all things considered, and once I learned to erase those barriers I'd constructed between my opponents and myself – to take the awesome hand I'd been dealt, and to turn those indigo Mediterranean Avenue deeds to Boardwalk blue, whatever it took – it all made sense. My scrappiness is ontological, but my mindset is not. That was the most important breakthrough I ever had.

And so, to the kids who think they'll never make it big (regardless of the walk of life you come from), this one's for you: never stop striving, but do it with respect and honest work and not an ounce of self-righteousness. Crowdsource your knowledge. Write down all feedback – even that which you don't understand – and Google all the terms later. Don't be afraid to ask older debaters and mentors questions like "what does Deleuze say" and "how do I answer fiat solves the link." I think there's an oft-forsaken quality to the archetypal novice beyond all the hilarious quotes and mistakes; novices still have that insatiable thirst for learning before the ego kicks in. We should always already all be novices. If there's one thing debate taught me, it's that learning is a continuum, and we are doing ourselves a disservice by bracketing the majority of it to one discrete stage of development. There is always so much more to learn, always another plane to strive for.

As varsity, mentors, coaches, and critics, we should likewise strive to make the best parts of the community visible to our youngest. As a member of certain infamous Facebook groups, I'm privy to a rather unsavory view of parts of this game, but as a member of this community I've witnessed more than enough redemption. I saw Miranda and Madison conduct themselves with grace, win or lose. I watched Brooke and Rayvon debate with an earnestness that contributed to the development of my own argumentative consciousness. I witnessed older and more experienced debaters take younger partners under their wings, and then I blinked and these once-tenderfeet were soaring on their own. The crowds of incredible minds helping equally-incredible younger minds for marginal recognition and even less pay; even the sophomores who dutifully ran from door to door scouting for new affs and taking crap from sleep-deprived, tense coaches. It's easy to forget between the spiteful journalism and vocal factions, but there is so much goodness in this community, and it's locked on a trajectory to improve even more.

Even now, debate has unquestionably changed me for the better. Through the turbulence I learned how to book cheap flights, operate all manner of showers, and pull an all-nighter using food-grade essential oils. Debate has inscribed an acute awareness of the privileges I enjoy, and given me the means to explore those I do not. It inculcated passion and lent me the ears and thoughts of so many brilliant individuals, and despite the violence that still tragically fractures our community, debate helped me find the people who love unceasingly and made room for me to belong. Debate trained me to argue, but taught me to advocate. It trained me to fight, but taught me to love.

We as a community are living on a fault line, the plates are shifting, and it can be a vitriolic and scary thing for everyone. But as more than a few people told me this weekend, it's in our hands now, and we are perfectly poised to take this messy, morphing activity and make it something a little more loving. Those people thought they were encouraging me to debate in college, when in reality that applies to so much more. We're all on the precipice of something, and sometimes it's up to you to make a good thing great. Erase the constructs that separate you from the world; always be learning; love as much as your disaffection will let you. Lean into the discomfort. Never stop dancing.
